# Automation
Scripts which automate processes I find tedious. 

1) delete.py:
  Basic script which will prompt you for a filepath and filetype(s). It will delete all files with the assigned extension within the given   path. The script will proide you with a list of each file it intends on deleting, as well as prompting the user for confirmation before deleting said files.

2) find_move.py:
   I tend to label images/vides, sometimes other files, with starting identifiers such as "11", "xx" etc. This script identifies, lists and  moves files with such prefixes to a new folder, either within its current path (if only given a foldername) or at a new destination. If you would like to only focus on files with a certain prefix then leave the extension prompt blank, same goes if you would only life to focus on certain filetypes- but both can be used in conjunction with each other
