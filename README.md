# Automation
Scripts which automate processes I find tedious. 

1) delete.py:
  Basic script which will prompt you for a filepath and filetype(s). It will delete all files with the assigned extension within the given   path. The script will proide you with a list of each file it intends on deleting, as well as prompting the user for confirmation before deleting said files.
